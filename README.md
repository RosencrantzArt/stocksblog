- **User** can create an account, comment on posts, and edit or delete their own comments.
- **Post** belongs to a **User** and can have many **Comments**.

- **Indexes**: It is recommended to create indexes on `user_id` and `post_id` in the **Comment** table to optimize queries that filter by user or post.

## Known Bugs
1. **Webmanifest File Failure**:  
   The webmanifest file (`/static/images/site.webmanifest`) fails to load properly on some devices, which may affect the display of the site icon when the site is added to the home screen on Android devices. This does not affect the core functionality of the blog but may be a problem for users who add the site to their home screen for offline use.

2. **Minor UI Glitch on Mobile**:
   On mobile devices, some text elements slightly overlap on the blog post cards in the main feed. This does not impact the content readability but should be addressed for a smoother user experience.

---

## Bugs That Do Not Affect Functionality
1. **Trailing Slash on Void Elements**: 
   Some self-closing tags, such as `<hr />`, still include trailing slashes. This does not cause any functionality issues on modern browsers but could lead to validation warnings. The site renders correctly across all browsers and devices.

2. **Font Loading on First Load**:  
   Occasionally, on the first load of the site (especially on slower networks), fonts may load slightly delayed, causing a flash of unstyled text (FOUT). This does not affect functionality but may impact the user experience on slower connections.

---

## Summary
The site is fully functional and responsive across tested devices, including the **Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6** and **iPhone 13**. The core features such as navigation, blog post rendering, pagination, and interactivity work as expected. There are a few known bugs, such as the webmanifest failing to load, but these do not affect the blog’s core functionality.

### Next Steps:
- Resolve the webmanifest loading issue to ensure better home screen experience for Android users.
- Address the minor UI glitches on mobile devices for a more polished mobile experience.
- Fix html code, It works, but it's not fully semantic

## Learnings and Mistakes

### What I Learned

1. **The Importance of Planning**  
   I didn’t initially plan the project step-by-step on a Kanban board, which led to a lack of structure in the development process. If I had planned more thoroughly, I could have avoided time-consuming backtracking.

2. **Simple Design is Key**  
   Trying to implement too many features in the design initially was overwhelming. I learned that it’s better to start simple and iterate later.

3. **Use of Bootstrap**  
   The use of **Bootstrap** significantly sped up the responsive design process, but I had to customize it to better fit the theme of my blog.

### Mistakes I Made

1. **Skipping the Paper Prototype**  
   In hindsight, designing the layout on paper before jumping into code would have helped me better understand the user flow on different devices. I later drew basic models of the site for **mobile** and **tablet** (iPad) views, which helped clarify the user experience and planning my prodject. 

2. **Lack of Error Handling in Forms**  
   I did not plan for robust error handling in the forms (user registration and commenting), which led to occasional frustration when users encountered vague errors.

3. **Underestimating complexity and time**  
   I started out to follow a turorial on YT, a prodject that was more complex than I unserstood. After a session with my mentor I diside to start over and follow the LMS as mush as possible.
